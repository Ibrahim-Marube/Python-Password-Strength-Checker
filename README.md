# Python-Password-Strength-Checker
Password Strength Checker
This Python tool offers the ability to assess the strength of your password.

Its functionality involves analyzing various aspects of a provided password, such as the count of letters, numbers, special characters, and whitespace characters. Based on this analysis, it computes a strength score. This project provides an excellent opportunity to gain insights into conditional statements, functions, and string formatting in Python.

In order to accomplish this, we leverage Python's standard library, specifically utilizing the 'string' and 'getpass' modules. The 'string' module grants access to the complete spectrum of string characters, enabling a comprehensive examination of the password's character composition. Additionally, we employ the '.getpass()' function to ensure the password input remains hidden for security purposes.
